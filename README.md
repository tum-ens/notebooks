In this repository, Jupyter Notebooks are collected for urbs data Processing.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your computer. Ensure, that you have [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) installed. It is recommended to install it and other necessary packages via conda and the provided environment file:

```
conda env create -f jnb.yml
```

The repository contains the used version of [urbs](https://github.com/tum-ens/urbs) for helper functions in the post-processing script.

## Used data
Unfortunately, the used data is not included in the Jupyter Notebooks. But the links to the sources, where to download the input files are included.

For the right execution of the notebooks data accuracy has to be fulfilled. Sometimes the raw data contains notations errors. Those have to be cleared before the data can be used in the notebooks. Known erros are mentioned in the notebooks.
